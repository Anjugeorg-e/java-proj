// now instaed of hardDRive obj = new harddrive(); we made a  connection betweeen 2 classes. which is caled as ependency 

//deendy injection we are doing in order to avoid tight coupling.(like hardcoding the connection)
//to achieve loose coupling we will use dependency injection

//eg. we have a class and that class working with a db object. we dont need to test db object
//so create a mock object for the class to check that alone...fr that the system should be loosely coupled.

//maven
  //accumulator of knowledge.
  //maven is a build tool that helps in project managemnet. the tool which helps in building and documneting the project
           //maven is based on project object model.
  //pom is an xml file which has all the info regarding project and configuration details.         
  //when we tend to execute a task maven searches for the pom in the current directory 

  //it helps in downloading dependencies.which refers to the libraries or jar files.
//problems that maven solved

  //getting right jar files for each proj as there may be diff versions of seprtae packages
  //to download dependencies we can just visit " mvnrepository.com "
  //helps to create right project structure which is essential for execution
  //building and deploying the project to makeit work
  //

  //maven simplifies the process of building a project
  //task of downloading jar files and other dependencies does not need to be done manually
  //provides easy acess to all required info
  //helps to manage alll process such s building documentaion releasing and distribution in project mangemnet.
