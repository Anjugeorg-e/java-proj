//maven is a build tool we use for building java applications
//dependency injection


//in order to achieve loose coupling (one obj doesnt depends on other obj ) we have to use dependency injection( tight coupling ---->  hjh obj1  =new hjh()  )

// mock object--> if a class and db object is loosely coupled, we can create a mock object for db . which will helps to test only
   //the  required component(class),

//maven
//build tool 
//which provides all the required dependencies or jars as we request to it. (helps instaed of downlaoding and updating t again)
// 

//inversion of control (IOC)
//ioc makes the code loosely coupled. and it is responsible to inject the dependency.


//pojo - plain old java object 
//spring applications use normal java objects rather than servers or enterprise containers.this makes applications more light weight
//



}
//spring beans

// instances of classes which are managed by spring
// spring manges all the dependencies of an object and instantiates the object into a bean after injecting the required dependencies.
//@component is the method for defining beans


//autowiring
